# PSP_GP-SRM_dissertation


This repository serves as a library for code for my dissertation - Probabilistic Spatial Prediction with Gaussian Processes via Scoring Rule Minimisation.
The aim of the project was to implement Scoring Rules as a inference methodology for spatial and general regression modelling frameworks. This work was predominantly written in PyTorch.


  Below is a brief overview of this repository:
  - _**Scoring Rules.ipynb**_ - Code for the Energy, Variogram and the weighted Energy-Variogram Scores
  - **_Linear Regression.ipynb_** - Code that implements Scoring Rule minimisation in Linear Regression models
  - _**Spatial_LMM_and_GLMM.ipynb**_ - Code for the implementation of Scoring Rule minimisation on the LMM and GLMM model frameworks
  - _**Gaussian Process Inference (Energy Score).ipynb**_ - Code for implementing the Scoring Rule Inference on Gaussian Processes via the Energy Score
  - _**Gaussian Process Inference (Variogram Score).ipynb**_ - Code for implementing the Scoring Rule Inference on Gaussian Processes via the Variogram Score
  - **_Gaussian Process Inference (Energy - Variogram Score).ipynb_** - Code for implementing the Scoring Rule Inference on Gaussian Processes via the weighted sum Energy - Variogram Score
  - _**GLMM with GP.ipynb**_ - Code that implements Scoring Rule minimisation on the full GLMM with Gaussian Process random effects model
