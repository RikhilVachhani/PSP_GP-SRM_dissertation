# PSP_GP-SRM_dissertation


This repository serves as a library for code for my dissertation - Probabilistic Spatial Prediction with Gaussian Processes via Scoring Rule Minimisation.
The aim of the project was to implement Scoring Rules as a inference methodology for spatial and general regression model framework. This work was predominantly written in PyTorch.


  Below is a brief overview of this repository:
