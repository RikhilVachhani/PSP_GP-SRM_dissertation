# PSP_GP-SRM_dissertation


This repository serves as a library for code for my dissertation - Probabilistic Spatial Prediction with Gaussian Processes via Scoring Rule Minimisation.
The aim of the project was to implement Scoring Rules as a inference methodology for spatial and general regression model framework. This work was predominantly written in PyTorch.


  Below is a brief overview of this repository:
  - _Scoring Rules.ipynb_ - Code for the Energy, Variogram and the weighted Energy-Variogram Scores
  - _Linear Regression.ipynb_ - Code that implements Scoring Rule minimisation in Linear Regression models
  - _Spatial_LMM_and_GLMM.ipynb_ - Code for the implementation of Scoring Rule minimisation on the LMM and GLMM model frameworks
  - _Gaussian Process Inference (Energy Score).ipynb_ - Code for implementing the Scoring Rule Inference on Gaussian Processes via the Energy Score
  - _Gaussian Process Inference (Variogram Score).ipynb_ - Code for implementing the Scoring Rule Inference on Gaussian Processes via the Variogram Score
  - _Gaussian Process Inference (Energy - Variogram Score).ipynb_ - Code for implementing the Scoring Rule Inference on Gaussian Processes via the wieghted sum Energy - Variogram Score
  - _GLMM with GP.ipynb_ - Code that implements Scoring Rule minimisation on the full GLMM with Gaussian Process random effects model
